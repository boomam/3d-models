# Port Light Colours
These covers are designed to basically hide the amazingly bright UDM-SE port status LEDs, so they dont sear your eyeballs off.

Two STLs, one can be fitted without removing cables, the other required cables to be removed for install.
Would recommend printing in PETG for greater temperature tollerances.
